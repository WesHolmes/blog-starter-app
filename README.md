# A Blog Starter App

This is a trivial blog application, started using Vite.

It works within a firebase database allowing information to be stored and recalled at anypoint using the application

In this web application you must first sign in, authenticating your user allows you to recall all previous posts and allows you to create new posts. Within the website you can create posts, find blog posts, and read posts. You can post about anything. There is a  header/Title box to create a header/title, and a main box prompting a new blog.
